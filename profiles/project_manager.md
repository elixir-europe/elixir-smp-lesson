title: Project Manager

**Thomas** is a project manager at a small non-profit research organization.
Three of the projects he's managing have produced significant amounts of data that now require analysis.
He is familiar with different aspects of project management but not software management.
His line manager recommended that he would complete a Software Management Plan for a ficticious software in order to get familiar with some of the language and terms used.
While completing the SMP, Thomas found many of his questions answered and felt better equipped to manage the software component of his future projects.
