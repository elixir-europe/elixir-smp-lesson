Janet is a researcher in an ambitious group. While primarily a wet-lab scientist, Janet shares her time between the lab and the computer where she performs data analysis. After a couple of years, the code used for the analysis was baptized and the group decided to publish it. As Janet only had some basic training in programming she worries that her code may have problems. A colleague suggested her to start by creating a Software Management Plan. After creating the SMP for her code, Janet now understands what she needs to do before publication for her code to be useful and usable to/by others.
