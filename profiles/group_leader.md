title: Group Leader at Company
---

Marc is a junior group leader in a pharmaceutical company. For many of the routine computational analysis in the group, software developed over a decade is being used. Most of the software was developed internally with code contributions from different developers over the years. The company is now considering converting the software into a product to be made available to insterested buyers. In order to better understand how to transform the software into a product, Marc was incentivized to elaborate a Software Management Plan. Creating an SMP provided a better understanding of compatibility of different licenses with a commercial model, the importance of testing and product quality control, ensuring the software produces reliable and replicable results for final users.
