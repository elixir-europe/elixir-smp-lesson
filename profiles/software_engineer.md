Rose is a trained software engineer with several years of programming experience. She is familiar with most software development best-practices, including versioning, testing and continuous integration (CI), as well as, the importance of documentation and choosing an appropriate license. She is responsible for several unpublished software projects in production for several years. In order to gain awareness of any expert blind spots and as a way to support the next cycle of funding for these projects, she decided to complete Software Management Plans for all of them. She realized she was not aware of how reproducibility became such a mission critical aspect of software use and development and was happy to find that as most of her software was automatically tested, many of the reproducibility aspects were already ensured.
