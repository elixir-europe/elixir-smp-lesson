# Stage 5: Publication (Publishing software and/or research results obtained with the software)

## Notes

- What is important at this stage and why (general)
- What are the SMP components (specific SMP questions) that are relevant here
- Describe what each of these components mean and require.


## Learning Outcomes

### Explain why publishing / depositing the software is relevant

> **Learning experience**    
> _Exercise_: Brainstorming on reasons to publish / deposit. 
> _Solution_: a list of reasons and explanation why these reasons are relevant. 
>  (For instructors to facilitate the brainstorming: link to relevant papers on the subject) @EVA

### Describe the key activities that need to happen during the publication phase.


#### Decide on where to publish / deposit the software

> _Narrative_: some narrative describing publication / depositing options and including key links to these options and their onboarding documentation 

> **Learning experience**

> _Exercise_: make a list of your key drivers / requirements when publishing your software. is it authorship on a primary publication, findability, reusability, contributing to a community, something else? which of the described options align closely with your drivers / requirements? do you know the expectations of your research community?

> _Solution_: a list of your requirements and which publication / registration / deposition options match that requirement best


#### Document the way people should cite the software

> _Narrative_: some narrative describing clear citation instructions / possibilities for software (including *.CFF) 

> **Learning experience**

> _Exercise_: challenge? create a *.CFF file based on your software? or maybe a brainstorm for what methods are most suited to the expectations of your specific life science community?

> _Solution_: 


#### Create persistent, global and unique identifiers that point to each released version of the software 

> _Narrative_: some narrative that outlines options for generating persistent identifiers for software 

> **Learning experience**

> _Exercise_: creation of persistent identifiers can relate directly to the location you publish or deposit your software. based on your list created above, which persistent identifier method is immediately available to you?
> discuss why this does or doesn't meet your expectations. if not, discuss what your other options are for generating an identifier, and the potential benefits of each 

> _Solution_: structured discussion and immediate options for creating identifiers


#### Keep an up-to-date CHANGELOG to clearly communicate changes to the software

> **Learning experience**
> _Exercise_: brainstorm reasons for maintaining a changelog. why is this necessary if version control is being used for development?
> _Solution_: reasons for changelog use, including explanation of the types of changes you might record in the log


### For each activity, explain why itâ€™s important.

1. Decide on where to publish / deposit the software - so that potential users can become aware of it and cite it when used
2. Documenting information about the way people should cite the software - essential to communicate how the authors want the work to be referenced by their peers, and lead the way to acknowledgement and recognition of their effort. 
3. create releases with a persistent global unique identifier pointing to each released version of the software - researchers need to be able to find (via the persistent identifier) a specific version of software that has been used to generate published results. This is crucial in order to facilitate reproducibility of research results. 
4. keep an up to date CHANGELOG to communicate changes - users should have sufficient information (e.g. through the CHANGELOG file) to assess the impact of the changes on ongoing projects that rely on the software

### Identify the specific SMP questions that are relevant in this Phase.

### Using the ELIXIR SMW, fill in the appropriate information to each SMP question that is relevant to this Phase.
