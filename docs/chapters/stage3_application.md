!!! info 
  This is the stage in which core functionality is developed in an iterative process. The software will most likely be developed with the use of toy example input data. During this stage, developers will document the code while writing it (inline documentation, docstrings etc.). It is also important to ensure that the code functions as intended (e.g. via unit tests or doctests). 
 
## Learning Outcomes

### 1. Describe which are the main activities that take place during the Application phase. 

#### a. Documenting how the software can be reliably used by yourself in several months, by people external to the development group but related to the scientific field, or any person

TO BE ADDED

> **Learning Experience** - *Exercise*

#### b. Providing tests as extensively as possible (ideally through automated processes)

>**Learning Experience** - *Discussion* 

!!! question "Discussion"

TO ADD

!!! question "Brainstorming"
> What are the advantages of using tests?

> *Narrative*: 
> Complement previous brainstorming 

The advantages of testing are: 

  1. Helps ensure that when something is fixed, it will not break other things or if it does, it will not go unnoticed. 
  2. Ensure that the documented functionality is stable, as well as identifying potential bugs and/or issues.
  3. Essential for reproducibility
  4. Enhance the overall trust that the software will work as intended


#### c. Setting up Communication channels  

Setting communication channels allow users to: 

- Report any problems or pose questions about deployment, usage and documentation 
- Address issues/bugs.


> **Learning Experience** - *Discussion*. 

!!! question "Discussion"
  What is your preferred communication channel as a user? and as a developer? Why?

2. For each activity, explain why it’s important.

        <li>Different user profiles require different communication channels. i.e. a potential developer and an end user could use different communication and reporting channels.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  

### 3. Identify the specific SMP questions that are relevant in this Phase. 


> *Narrative*: 
> 
SMP questions relevant to this phase: 

- What type of documentation is available, provided with the software and delivered under the same conditions? 
  - Documentation in general as well as README, API documentation, docstring in source code, input and usage examples, and tutorial in particular are relevant. 

!!! danger "Questions not mapped yet in the SMP"
  Some questions that belong here are still not mapped in the [SMP wizard](https://smw.ds-wizard.org/km-editor/editor/f311aeda-cff2-4155-b2f8-1208876d39ec/question-tags)

### 4. Using the ELIXIR SMW, fill in the appropriate information to each SMP question that is relevant to this Phase. 

> **Learning Experience** - *Exercise*: 

!!! example "Challenge 3"
  Go to the project in the [SMW](https://smw.ds-wizard.org/) and complete the previous questions for a piece of software.
