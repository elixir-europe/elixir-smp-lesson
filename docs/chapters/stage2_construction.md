# Stage 2: Construction (prototyping, construction and implementing core functionality)
#### Learning Outcomes:

**1. Describe what are the key decisions that need to be made during the Construction phase.**
- testing approach needs to be defined (incl. the list of the types of test implemented and relevant test parameters)
- include also sample example input and output files.
- the actual scope, goals and purpose of the software needs to be defined and documented

**2. For each decision, explain why itâ€™s important.**
- testing approach needs to be defined (incl. the list of the types of test implemented and relevant test parameters)
    a. to ensure that the code functions as intended
    b. tests can also act as documentation by showing how the software can be executed and configured
- include also sample example input and output files.
    a. necessary for the development of functioning software, and for ensuring that it works as intended
- the actual scope, goals and purpose of the software needs to be defined and documented
    a. is necessary in focussing the development effort and avoiding feature creep
    b. Crucial in defining functional tests

**3.Identify the specific SMP questions that are relevant in this Phase.**

**4.Using the ELIXIR SMW, fill in the appropriate information to each SMP question that is relevant to this Phase.**
