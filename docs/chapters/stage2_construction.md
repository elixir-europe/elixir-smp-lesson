# Stage 2: Construction (prototyping, construction and implementing core functionality)

!!! info

    This is the stage in which the main development of the software is taking place and its core functionality is developed in an iterative process. The software will most likely be developed with the use of toy example input data, developers will document the code while writing it (inline documentation, docstrings etc.). It is also important to ensure that the code functions as intended (e.g. via unit tests or doctests).

#### Learning Outcomes:

**1. Describe what are the key decisions that need to be made during the Construction phase.**

>#### Learning experience:
> In small groups groups, learners will try to answer the following questions: 
> - Which testing approach will be used (including the list of the types of test implemented and relevant test parameters)?
> - Does the testing approach also include sample example input and output files?
> - What are the actual scope, goals and purpose of the software? How will these be documented?
> They will write their answers in a shared document. 
> The instructor will discuss the answers and use the discussion as a starting point to deliver the following narrative.  

#### NEXT TIME: START FROM HERE
>#### Narrative: 
> - How to test your software (different types of testing approaches)
>   --> None, Unit, Integration, Functional, End-to-end, Linting, Regression, Frontend - GUI, Other (e.g.)
> - Features of example input and output files (recommendations on how to create "ideal" test files)
> - Effective ways to document your software

**2. For each decision, explain why itâ€™s important.**
- testing approach needs to be defined (incl. the list of the types of test implemented and relevant test parameters)

    a. to ensure that the code functions as intended
    b. tests can also act as documentation by showing how the software can be executed and configured
    
- include also sample example input and output files.

    a. necessary for the development of functioning software, and for ensuring that it works as intended
    
- the actual scope, goals and purpose of the software needs to be defined and documented

    a. is necessary in focussing the development effort and avoiding feature creep
    
    b. Crucial in defining functional tests

**3.Identify the specific SMP questions that are relevant in this Phase.**

1) Documentation: What type of documentation is available, provided with the software and delivered under the same conditions? Please provide a URL (when available).
2) Documentation: Is the purpose of the software stated in the documentation?
3) Documentation: Does the documentation describe how to test the software?
4) Testing: What type of testing do you use?
5) Testing: Are sample data and/or parameters that can be used to test the software available with the source code?

**4.Using the ELIXIR SMW, fill in the appropriate information to each SMP question that is relevant to this Phase.**
