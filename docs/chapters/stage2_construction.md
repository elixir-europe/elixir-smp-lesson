# Stage 2: Construction (prototyping, construction and implementing core functionality)

#### Learning Outcomes:

**1. Describe what are the key decisions that need to be made during the Construction phase.**

This is the stage in which the main development of the software is taking place and its core functionality is developed in an iterative process. The software will most likely be developed with the use of toy example input data, developers will document the code while writing it (inline documentation, docstrings etc.). It is also important to ensure that the code functions as intended (e.g. via unit tests or doctests).

'''
Learning experience:
In small groups groups, learners will try to answer the following questions: 
- Which testing approach will be used (including the list of the types of test implemented and relevant test parameters)?
- Does the testing approach also include sample example input and output files?
- What are the actual scope, goals and purpose of the software? How will these be documented?
'''

#### NEXT TIME: START FROM HERE
Narrative: 
- How to test your software
- Features of example input and output files (recommendations on how to create ideal test files)
- Effective ways to document your software



**2. For each decision, explain why itâ€™s important.**
- testing approach needs to be defined (incl. the list of the types of test implemented and relevant test parameters)

    a. to ensure that the code functions as intended
    b. tests can also act as documentation by showing how the software can be executed and configured
    
- include also sample example input and output files.

    a. necessary for the development of functioning software, and for ensuring that it works as intended
    
- the actual scope, goals and purpose of the software needs to be defined and documented

    a. is necessary in focussing the development effort and avoiding feature creep
    
    b. Crucial in defining functional tests

**3.Identify the specific SMP questions that are relevant in this Phase.**

**4.Using the ELIXIR SMW, fill in the appropriate information to each SMP question that is relevant to this Phase.**
