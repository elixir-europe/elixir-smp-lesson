# Stage 2: Construction (prototyping, construction and implementing core functionality)

!!! info

    This is the stage in which the main development of the software is taking place and its core functionality is developed in an iterative process. The software will most likely be developed with the use of toy example input data, developers will document the code while writing it (inline documentation, docstrings etc.). It is also important to ensure that the code functions as intended (e.g. via unit tests or doctests).
    
#### Learning Outcomes:

**1. Describe what are the key decisions that need to be made during the Construction phase.**

 What is important? During the Construction phase, there are two main types of important decisions that should be taken:
1. How will you test your software? How will you make sure it works as intended? This also includes decisions about sample input data that will be used to test the software, as well as decisions about what will be the output of your software.
2. How are you going to document your code? The documentation should describe not only what the various parts of code do, but also the actual scope, goals and purpose of the software and how to test it. Therefore, you should decide what would be effective ways to document your software.

### Testing or ensuring software functions as intended

> **Learning Experience** - *Exercise*: 

!!! example "Challenge 1"
> Learners answer individually the following questions in a shared document: 
> Think about a piece of software you recently developed or you're developing.
> - Did you test it? / Are you testing it?
> - Which testing approach(es) are you using?
> - Does your testing approach also include sample example input and output files?
> - If yes, what are the relevant features of such files?
> - Which testing approach(es) do you use normally? Would you be able to make a list of the types of tests you usually implement and of the corresponding relevant test parameters?
> 
> The instructor will discuss the answers and use the discussion as a starting point to deliver the content below.  

------------------------------------------
> *Narrative............................... 
NOTE: I REALISED THE NARRATIVE REGARDING **DIFFERENT (COMMON) TYPES OF TESTING APPROACHES** I WANTED TO INSERT HERE IS ALREADY PRESENT IN STAGE 3 (WRITTEN BY EVA). I BELIEVE IT WOULD FIT BETTER HERE (CONSTRUCTION) THAN IN STAGE 3 (APPLICATION). WHAT DO YOU THINK?*

#### Different (common) types of testing approaches
>   --> None, Unit, Integration, Functional, End-to-end, Linting, Regression, Frontend - GUI, Other (e.g.)
>   
------------------------------------------

#### Sample example input and output files.
Sample input and output files are necessary for the development of functioning software, and for ensuring that it works as intended.
These files should have the same format and content type of the actual data files, i.e. those for which the software is being developed. However, they should *not* be the actual data files, as these cannot be always kept under control and it may be difficult to decipher how your software behaves when running on actual data file. Aspects you should think about when you create toy example input data are:
- *file size*. The the size of the file should be such that you have complete control over input and output. Ideally, you should be able to do manually the calculations that your software does automatically, so that you know in advance what you can expect the output file will contain. Unless you specifically need to test the performance of the software on big data files, the smaller the input file size, the better.
- *file format*. Input file format need to be exactly the same as the actual data files. 
- *file content*. The content of the file should be exactly of the same type of the actual data file and include all the possibilities and potential exceptions that could be observed in actual data. 

### Documenting your code

> **Learning Experience** - *Exercise*: 

!!! example "Challenge 2"
> In groups, each learner will describe to the other group memebers: 
> - What are the actual scope, goals and purpose of their software (referring to a piece of software they recently developed or are developing); 
> - How will scope, goals and purpose be documented;
> - What type of documentation is available or they plan to make available.
> Each group will discuss purposes, advantages and disadvantages of the various ways of documenting software/code.
> The instructor will facilitate a discussion on "How many different ways can be used to document software? Is there any that is more effective than others?"

**2. For each decision, explain why itâ€™s important.**

> **Learning Experience** - *Exercise*: 

!!! example "Challenge 3"
> The instructor will facilitate a discussion on the following three spects:
>  - "Why defining functional tests is important?
>  Why sample input and output files are necessary? 
>  What's the purpose of documenting software?" 

> *Narrative*
Why is it important? Sample input and output files are necessary for the development of functioning software, and for ensuring that it works as intended. Having the purpose (scope, and possible constraints) of the software clearly documented is necessary in focussing the development effort and avoiding feature creep. It is also crucial towards defining functional tests. Tests can also act as documentation by showing how the software can be executed and configured, but they should not be a replacement for the in-depth documentation.


Defiining how your software will be tested during development is essential to ensure that the code functions as intended. Tests can also act as documentation by showing how the software can be executed and configured
    
Including sample example input and output files is absolutely necessary for the development of functioning software, and for ensuring that it works as intended.
    
Writing good documentation to your software will help create more readable and efficient code with minimal errors. It is necessary in focussing the development effort and avoiding feature creep, and crucial in defining functional tests.


> From the [Berkley Library Guide on how to write good documentation](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/how-to-write-good-documentation):

> Documentation effectively connects humans and machines.

> Why writing documentation is important:
> For you:
> - You will be using your code in 6 months
> - You want people to use your code and give you credit
> - You want to learn self-determination
> - Others would be encouraged to contribute to your code
> For others: 
> - Others can easily use your code and build upon it
> For science:
> - Advances the science
> - Encourages open science 
> - Allows reproducibility and transparency

**3.Identify the specific SMP questions that are relevant in this Phase.**

SMP questions relevant to this phase:

1) Documentation: What type of documentation is available, provided with the software and delivered under the same conditions? Please provide a URL (when available).
2) Documentation: Is the purpose of the software stated in the documentation?
3) Documentation: Does the documentation describe how to test the software?
4) Testing: What type of testing do you use?
5) Testing: Are sample data and/or parameters that can be used to test the software available with the source code?

**4.Using the ELIXIR SMW, fill in the appropriate information to each SMP question that is relevant to this Phase.**

> **Learning Experience** - *Exercise*: 

!!! example "Challenge 3"
  Go to the project in the [SMW](https://smw.ds-wizard.org/) and complete the previous questions for a piece of software.
