## Learning Outcomes

### 1. Describe **what** are the key considerations that need to be made aware during the Production phase.

#### a. ensure the (re-)use and reproducibility of the software

 > *Narrative*: Explain that (re-)use and reproducibility of the software are fundamental aspects of a research software, when considered ready for production phase.
 > 
 
 >**Learning experience**
 >
 >*Exercise*

### 2. For each consideration, explain why itâ€™s important.

```
a. ensure the (re-)use and reproducibility of the software

Software often depends on libraries and their versions that may not be available on some systems. Packaging the software into easy-to-use forms can greatly facilitate its (re)use and adoption, as well as ensure (to an extent) its reproducibility.

### 3. Identify the specific SMP questions that are relevant in this Phase.

> *Narrative*:  
> 
> Enumerate the questions: 
> 
> - Interoperability?


### 4. Using the ELIXIR SMW, fill in the appropriate information to each SMP question that is relevant to this Phase.

> **Learning Experience** 
> 
> *Exercise*: 
> 
> Go to the workspace you just created in the [SMW](https://smw.ds-wizard.org/) and complete the previous questions for a piece of software.
