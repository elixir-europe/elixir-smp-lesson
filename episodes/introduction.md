teaching: 10
exercises: 2
---

# Overview

1. Target audience (probably similar to the 4OSS lesson)
    1. Research software Engineers (RSEs)(people writing the software need to be aware of the basic principles to follow)
    2. Researchers developing software (people writing the software need to be aware of the basic principles to follow)
    3. Principal Investigators / Group Leads (they can use the SMP to ensure compliance with best practices)
    4. Project managers (they have a vested interest that in-house research output meets criteria and is sustainable)
2. Levels:
    1. Remember
    2. Understand
    3. Apply

3. Prerequisites:
    1. To have a working understanding of the research software development process
    2. Coding experience is useful, but not necessary

3. Goals
    1. Understand which parts of the SMP are critical for each Software Development Stage
    2. Understand the implications of the different choices provided in the SMP.
    3. Be able to fill in the required information across all sections of the SMP in the ELIXIR Software Management Wizard (SMW)

# Introduction
## Learning Outcomes
- Explain what is the purpose of a management plan and why this is a good practice for Open Science.
- List/Highlight what are the key differences between managing data and managing software.
- Identify the two main groups of stakeholders for the SMP.
- Describe the five Software Development Stages.
## Notes on content
- Why and What is a Management Plan
- Difference of a DMP vs SMP
- Can we deal with software in the same way as data?
- Use the differences in FAIR principles as an example.
- Personas based on the SMP Stakeholders: Group 1 (Users / Benefiters / Enforcers) and Group 2 (Adopters)
- Make a list of potential stakeholders, and the learners have to identify which group each belongs to.
- Outline of the Software Development Stages
