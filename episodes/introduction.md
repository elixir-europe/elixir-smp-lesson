teaching: 10
exercises: 2

Lesson structure:

1. Target audience (probably similar to the 4OSS lesson)
    1. Research software Engineers (RSEs)(people writing the software need to be aware of the basic principles to follow)
    2. Researchers developing software (people writing the software need to be aware of the basic principles to follow)
    3. Principal Investigators / Group Leads (they can use the SMP to ensure compliance with best practices)
    4. Project managers (they have a vested interest that in-house research output meets criteria and is sustainable)
2. Levels:
    1. Remember
    2. Understand
    3. Apply

3. Prerequisites:
    1. To have a working understanding of the research software development process
    2. Coding experience is useful, but not necessary

3. Goals
    1. Understand which parts of the SMP are critical for each Software Development Stage
    2. Understand the implications of the different choices provided in the SMP.
    3. Be able to fill in the required information across all sections of the SMP in the ELIXIR Software Management Wizard (SMW)


Notes (for all stages):

* What is important at this stage and why (general)
* What are the SMP components (specific SMP questions) that are relevant here
* Describe what each of these components mean, require and imply.
