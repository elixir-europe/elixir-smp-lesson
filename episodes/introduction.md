# Overview

1. Target audience (probably similar to the 4OSS lesson)
    1. Research software Engineers (RSEs)(people writing the software need to be aware of the basic principles to follow)
    2. Researchers developing software (people writing the software need to be aware of the basic principles to follow)
    3. Principal Investigators / Group Leads (they can use the SMP to ensure compliance with best practices)
    4. Project managers (they have a vested interest that in-house research output meets criteria and is sustainable)
2. Levels:
    1. Remember
    2. Understand
    3. Apply

3. Prerequisites:
    1. To have a working understanding of the research software development process
    2. Coding experience is useful, but not necessary

3. Goals
    1. Understand which parts of the SMP are critical for each Software Development Stage
    2. Understand the implications of the different choices provided in the SMP.
    3. Be able to fill in the required information across all sections of the SMP in the ELIXIR Software Management Wizard (SMW)

# Introduction
## Learning Outcomes
- Explain what is the purpose of a management plan and why this is a good practice for Open Science.
- List/Highlight what are the key differences between managing data and managing software.
- Identify the two main groups of stakeholders for the SMP.
- Describe the five Software Development Stages.
- Access the SMW and create a project, i.e. a workspace where you can create your SMP 

## Learning Experiences
LO: Explain what is the purpose of a management plan and why this is a good practice for Open Science.
LO: List the key differences between managing data and managing software.
### Narrative:     
#### Management plans
Questions: 
    - What is a Management Plan? 
    - Why a Management Plan? 
    - What are the differences between managing data and managing software?
    - What is the difference between a DMP and a SMP?

> Exercise: in groups. Discuss: 1) what could be the purpose of a management plan (in general); 2) what could be the purpose of a Data Management Plan; 3) what could be the purpose of a Software Management Plan.
> Solution: groups summarise the answers to the three questions and write them on sticky notes for later use.

Data management is the practice of collecting, organising, storing, maintaining, and using data securely, efficiently and cost-effectively. Software developed during the course of research, like data, should be managed appropriately. Although general data management principles can be applied to software development, managing software consists in planning and leading the process of developing and publishing software, since its inception throughout all the phases of its planning, development, delivery, use, and publishing. A management plan is a comprehensive plan that describes the objectives of any given project, clearly defines roles and responsibilities, the strategies used to meet the objectives, and the methods used to measure performance (= the achievement of objectives/deliverables). It is a resource that can be used as a guideline in the initial phases of a project, as well as throughout its execution, thus ensuring that everything operates smoothly.
Data Management Plans (DMPs) are a cornerstone of good data management and are now considered a key element of Open Science practices. A DMP describes the data management life cycle for the data to be collected, processed and/or generated within the lifetime of a particular project or activity. A Software Management Plan (SMP) is a device wihch may help formalise a set of structures and goals that ensure the software is accessible and reusable in the short, medium and long term. Although it has a management perspective, the main advantage of an SMP is that it provides clear context to the software that is being developed. In that sense, it addresses several aspects of the software development process such as (a) supporting reproducibility and reusability of the software, (b) allowing funding agencies to have a better grasp of the envisioned development process (as well as the achieved milestones), (c) increasing the awareness of the existing community standards that can/should be used, and (d) ensuring that the software can be easily accessed by the wider community.

(Can we deal with software in the same way as data?) (Use the differences in FAIR principles as an example.)

## Notes on content

- Personas based on the SMP Stakeholders: Group 1 (Users / Benefiters / Enforcers) and Group 2 (Adopters)
- Make a list of potential stakeholders, and the learners have to identify which group each belongs to.
