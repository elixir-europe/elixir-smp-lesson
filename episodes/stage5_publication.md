# Stage 5: Publication (Publishing software and/or research results obtained with the software)

## Notes

- What is important at this stage and why (general)
- What are the SMP components (specific SMP questions) that are relevant here
- Describe what each of these components mean and require.


## Learning Outcomes
1. Explain why publishing / depositing the software is relevant 
> **Learning experience**    
> _Exercise_: Brainstorming on reasons to publish / deposit. 
> _Solution_: a list of reasons and explanation why these reasons are relevant. 
>  (For instructors to facilitate the brainstorming: link to relevant papers on the subject) @EVA
2. Describe what are the key activities that need to be made during the publication phase.
    1. Decide on where to publish / deposit the software 
> _Narrative_: some narrative describing publication/depositing options 
> _Exercise_:
> _Solution_: 
    3. Documenting information about the way people should cite the software
    4. create releases with a persistent global unique identifier pointing to each released version of the software
    5. keep an up to date CHANGELOG to communicate changes
4. For each activity, explain why itâ€™s important.
    1. Decide on where to publish / deposit the software - so that potential users can become aware of it and cite it when used
    2. Documenting information about the way people should cite the software - essential to communicate how the authors want the work to be referenced by their peers, and lead the way to acknowledgement and recognition of their effort.
    3. create releases with a persistent global unique identifier pointing to each released version of the software - researchers need to be able to find (via the persistent identifier) a specific version of software that has been used to generate published results. This is crucial in order to facilitate reproducibility of research results.
    4. keep an up to date CHANGELOG to communicate changes - users should have sufficient information (e.g. through the CHANGELOG file) to assess the impact of the changes on ongoing projects that rely on the software
5. Identify the specific SMP questions that are relevant in this Phase.
6. Using the ELIXIR SMW, fill in the appropriate information to each SMP question that is relevant to this Phase.
