# Learning Outcomes

## 1. Describe what are the main activities that take place during the Application phase.

## b. Providing tests as extensively as possible (ideally through automated processes 

## c. Setting up Communication channels 

# 2. For each activity, explain why itâ€™s important.

## a. Documenting how the software can be reliably used by people external to the development group or person to ensure adoption/use of the software outside the original developer

## b. Providing tests as extensively as possible(ideally through automated processes helps ensure that when something is fixed, it will not break other things or if it does, it will not go unnoticed. 

## c Ensure that the documented functionality is stable, as well as identifying potential bugs and/or issues.

## d. Essential for reproducibility

## e. Enhance the overall trust that the software will work as intended

# 3. Setting up Communication channels

## a. Users to report any problems or pose questions about usage and documentation 

## b. clarifying the process to address issues/bugs
