> :bulb: *Reminder*: This is the stage in which core functionality is developed in an iterative process. The software will most likely be developed with the use of toy example input data. During this stage, developers will document the code while writing it (inline documentation, docstrings etc.). It is also important to ensure that the code functions as intended (e.g. via unit tests or doctests). 
 
# Learning Outcomes

## 1. Describe what are the main activities that take place during the Application phase. 

### a. Documenting how the software can be reliably used by people external to the development group or person 

> *Narrative*: explain how clearly documenting the purpose (scope and possible constraints) of the software is necessary in focussing the development effort (this stage) and avoiding feature creep. It is also crucial towards defining functional tests. 

> **Learning Experience** 
> 
> *Exercise:* 
> 
> Think of three pieces of software you normally use. 
> Imagine you are working on a new project where, unfortunateyl, you can't use them due to some licensing incompatibilities. Your only alternative is to develop them from scratch for your usual purposes. Two colleagues, both experienced research software engineers, will help you with the development to speed up the process. Write the purpose (scope, constraints, etc) of the softwares so they have a clear idea of what you are going to build and can start working. 

### b. Providing tests as extensively as possible (ideally through automated processes 

### c. Setting up Communication channels 

## 2. For each activity, explain why itâ€™s important.

### a. Documenting how the software can be reliably used by people external to the development group or person 

#### i. to ensure adoption/use of the software outside the original developer

### b. Providing tests as extensively as possible(ideally through automated processes 

#### i. Helps ensure that when something is fixed, it will not break other things or if it does, it will not go unnoticed. 

#### ii. Ensure that the documented functionality is stable, as well as identifying potential bugs and/or issues.

#### iii. Essential for reproducibility

#### iv. Enhance the overall trust that the software will work as intended

### c. Setting up Communication channels

#### i. Users to report any problems or pose questions about usage and documentation 

#### ii. clarifying the process to address issues/bugs 

## 3. Identify the specific SMP questions that are relevant in this Phase.

## 4. Using the ELIXIR SMW, fill in the appropriate information to each SMP question that is relevant to this Phase. 

> **Learning Experience**

> Go to the workspace you just created in the [SMW](https://smw.ds-wizard.org/) and complete the previous questions for a piece of software.
